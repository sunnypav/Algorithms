I am fascinated towards Real World Problems and i learn from real world scenarios. Algorithms are the perfect aresenal for
the real worlds so i read them and will try to implement them in java. Its just 100% pure personal interest.

I will keep Updating this branch with the algorithms i have read and implemented.

Thanks,
Happy Coding
