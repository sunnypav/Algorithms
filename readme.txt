I am fascinated towards Real World Problems and i learn from real world scenarios. Algorithms are the perfect aresenal for
the real worlds so i read them and will try to implement them in java. Its just 100% pure personal interest.

I will keep Updating this branch with the algorithms i have read and implemented.

Folder creditcard -- Contains the implementation of Luhn Algorithm which will be used in credit cards and is a kind of error
detection in the given credit card. It also contains a Menu program to just to play around with. Test data for the Luhn algorithm
can be found at http://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/credit_card_numbers.htm

Happy Coding
